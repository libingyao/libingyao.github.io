    My research interests lie broadly in 
    <strong>advanced computer architectures</strong>, 
    <strong>high-performance computing systems</strong>, and 
    <strong>emerging parallel applications</strong>, with a specific focus on the GPU ecosystem from architecture to application. My work aims to design architectures and system features for next-generation GPU systems, enabling and supporting emerging large-scale applications on both single- and multi-GPU platforms. I am also actively working on system-level optimizations for 
    <strong>large language model serving</strong>.
